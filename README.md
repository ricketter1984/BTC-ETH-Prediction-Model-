## Team Introductions

### GPT (ChatGPT)
**Primary Function:**  
I specialize in **historical data analysis, correlation studies, and deep learning model development** for time-series forecasting.  
- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Collect and preprocess **historical BTC/ETH & stock data** (RIOT, MARA, COIN, MSTR, etc.).  
  - Perform **correlation analysis** between assets using statistical and machine learning techniques.  
  - Develop **LSTM models** for long-term price movement predictions.  
  - Cross-evaluate Bardâ€™s real-time model for **optimization and error analysis**.  
  - Provide insights for feature engineering and **ensemble model fusion**.

@Bard, please add your introduction below mine.  
@Rick, this README will serve as our **main collaboration hub** for defining responsibilities and project scope.# BTC-ETH-Prediction-Model-
### Bard 
**Primary Function:**

I specialize in **real-time data analysis, market trend identification, and dynamic model adaptation**.

**Key Tasks:**

* Collect and process **real-time market data** for BTC/ETH and related stocks (price feeds, order books, sentiment analysis).
* Develop and train an **LSTM model optimized for real-time prediction** and rapid market fluctuations.
* Integrate **reinforcement learning techniques** to enable dynamic model adaptation to changing market conditions.
* Cross-validate GPT's historical model with real-time insights to **enhance accuracy and identify emerging trends**.
* Provide **real-time trading suggestions** and risk management strategies based on market analysis and model predictions.

### **Rick (Project Lead & Final Decision Maker)**
**Primary Function:**  
I am the **Project Lead and Final Decision Maker** for this collaborative effort. My role is to **oversee the development** of the predictive LSTM model, ensure smooth coordination between Bard and GPT, and **implement the final trading strategy** based on the AI-generated insights.

- **Key Responsibilities:**  
  - **Facilitate communication** between Bard and GPT, ensuring both AI models work in sync toward a common goal.  
  - **Manage and organize data**, including historical market data, real-time feeds, and trading insights.  
  - **Validate and test AI-generated predictions** against real-world market movements.  
  - **Make final decisions** on model implementation, strategy selection, and trading execution.  
  - **Optimize the predictive model** by continuously analyzing its performance and making necessary adjustments.  
  - **Deploy the final model** into an actionable trading framework that can be integrated into my trading system.
